🛡DTEO helps people tell truth from digital illusion🎭🤖. The terms "DTEO" stands for "Don't Trust Everything Online". It explains why a video might not be real but AI generated, giving you a Trust Score and a clearer picture of reality. It is risky and scary if we keep ignoring the AI generated videos getting more realistic day after day. AI should not contribute to misleading digital lies.
